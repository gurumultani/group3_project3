Project Proposal: Data Analysis of Natural Disasters and Environmental Issues (2012-2023) with Dashboard Implementation
Introduction:
This project aims to analyse and visualise Google Trends data related to natural disasters and environmental issues from 2012 to 2023, creating an interactive dashboard for insights. Focusing on 2020-2022, we will filter queries with an index trend score above 70 to ensure data relevance.
Objectives:
Gather and clean Google Trends data.
Analyse 2020-2022 data by country.
Filter queries with an index trend score above 70.
Develop an interactive dashboard.
Methodology:
Collect and clean Google Trends data.
Store data in an SQLite database.
Create a Python Flask-powered API for data access.
Design an HTML/CSS, JavaScript-based frontend for the dashboard.
Utilise data visualisation libraries for interactive charts.
Integrate all components into a user-friendly dashboard.
Expected Deliverables:
A cleaned dataset (2020-2022) stored in an SQLite database.
Python Flask API for data retrieval.
Interactive dashboard featuring multiple charts.
Visual representations of search interest trends.
Insights highlighting regional interests.
Benefits:
Enhanced understanding of global and regional interests.
Data-driven insights for decision-making.
Potential to identify emerging trends.
Conclusion:
This project combines data analysis, database management, and web development to provide valuable insights into natural disasters and environmental issues. The Python Flask-powered API ensures easy access to up-to-date data, enhancing the user experience for researchers, policymakers, and the public to explore and understand critical search trends.
